Count up ratings given for each movie
    - All you need is to change one thing in the mapper - we don't care about ratings now, we care about movie ID's!
    - Start with this and make sure you can do it.
    - You can use nano to just edit the existing RatingsBreakdown.py

Stretch goal
    * Sort the movies by their numbers of ratings
    * Strategy
        - Map to (movieID, 1) key/value pairs
        - Reduce with output of (rating count, movieID)
        - Send this to a second reducer so we end up with things sorted by rating count!
    * Gotchas:
        - How do we set up more than one MapReduce step?
        - How do we ensure the rating counts are sorted properly?
